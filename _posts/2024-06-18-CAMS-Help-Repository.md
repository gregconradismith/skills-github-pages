Alright, this is supposed to be a quick draft of a blog post.

Hi Everyone,

I have been putting a bunch of the “help” and “examples” that I’ve written over the years for my students onto GitHub (see below).  I was wondering … would it be worth it to rebrand this as a CAMS repository and solicit contributions from CAMS faculty?  The idea being that perhaps more people would make use of the materials if it was advertised in that way.

Anyone who is not comfortable with “forks” and “pull requests” … could just email me whatever they thought would make a good contribution and I’d install it.
